RE: Critical Security Patch Deployed - Validation Needed

So... you found something. Fine.

Before you get too excited, I want to emphasize that this was a *known issue* that we were already planning to address in Q3. Your "exploit" simply accelerated our roadmap. We're very agile here.

**What We Did:**

Our senior engineers held an emergency standup (4 minutes, new record) and identified the root cause: excessive information disclosure in the verification step. Classic rookie mistake by those academics.

The fix was elegantly simple - we removed the problematic output statement. The oracle is now effectively blind to its own verification process. I'm told this is called "defense in depth" by people who know these things.

**Post-Patch Validation:**

Management is requiring a re-audit before we go live. Frankly, I think it's overkill - the vulnerability was in the *output*, which we removed. But compliance is compliance.

Run your tests. Take your time. You won't find anything.

**P.S.** - The 1-second timeout is still in place. The CFO says server costs are "concerning." We're disrupting the industry here, not running a charity.
