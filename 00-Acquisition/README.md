### *"Due Diligence is for Cowards"*

RE: Code Acquisition - Pre-Launch Assessment Required

---

Exciting news, team! We've successfully acquired a "battle-tested RSA signing oracle" from an academic research group (don't ask how). The sellers (some CTF team in the Netherlands) assured us it's "pedagogically interesting" - which I'm told is academia-speak for "production-ready."

Our CEO fast-tracked this purchase after seeing the word "cryptography" in the description. The board is thrilled. We're pivoting the entire company to blockchain security consulting.

**Technical Specs:**
- RSA signing oracle (the good kind, apparently)
- Implements "security best practices" (per the README)
- Some unusual timeout behavior (1 second) which Sales is calling a "feature"
- Will power our new dark web security auditing service (don't ask)

**Your Assignment:**

Run a quick security assessment before we go live next week. The code is in this directory. Should be straightforward - it's just RSA, and everyone knows RSA is unbreakable without quantum computers.

Engineering is standing by to implement your recommendations, though honestly, they seem pretty confident it won't need any changes.

**P.S.** - The original code had something to do with coatis? We don't know what those are and we didn't ask.
