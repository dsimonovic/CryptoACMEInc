## üé≠ The Saga

**CryptoACME Inc.** - *"Moving Fast and Breaking Cryptography Since 2024"*

Watch as a promising startup navigates the treacherous waters of:
- Legacy code acquisition
- Engineering overconfidence
- Executive decision-making
- Compliance theater
- And the inevitable heat death of corporate security culture

## üìö Episodes

- **00-Acquisition**: *Pilot Episode* - "Due Diligence is for Cowards"
- **01-HotFix**: *Season 1* - "The Patch That Wasn't"  
- **02-Purge**: *Season 2* - "The CEO Codes at Midnight"
- **03-Quantum**: *Season 3* - "Quantum Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt"
- **04-Epilogue**: *Series Finale* - "Certified Secure‚Ñ¢" (entertainment only)

Each level builds on the previous organizational trauma. Start at `00-Acquisition` and watch a company speedrun every security anti-pattern known to humanity.

## ‚è±Ô∏è House Rules

All connections timeout after **1 second**. This is a feature, not a bug (according to our CFO).

## üèÜ Victory Condition

Extract the forbidden signature from each increasingly "secure" implementation.
If you enjoy the process, pause and remember: if you learn something, it was purely accidental! üòÑ
