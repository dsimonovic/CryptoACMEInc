# Level 2: The Purge
### *"How Hard Can Crypto Be?"*

RE: Organizational Restructuring & New Security Architecture

I don't know who you are or how you keep getting in, but you're clearly working with my former employees. There's no other explanation.

**Effective immediately:**
- Engineering team: TERMINATED
- Security team: TERMINATED  
- DevOps: TERMINATED
- The intern who looked nervous: TERMINATED

They took everything when they left - the intellectual property, the AWS root credentials, that mechanical keyboard I really liked. Good riddance. CryptoACME Inc. doesn't need dead weight.

**The Real Problem:**

After 72 hours of intensive self-study (YouTube, StackOverflow, and one podcast about blockchain), I've identified the fundamental flaw in our approach:

The "public" key was literally public. 

This is embarrassing to even write out. We were just... showing people the keys to the kingdom? What kind of amateur hour operation were we running?

**My Solution:**

I rebuilt the entire system myself over the weekend. From the ground up. No more public exposure of cryptographic parameters. No more "standard" configurations. I even tested the old attack vectors myself to make sure they don't work anymore.

The new architecture is secure by design because nobody knows how it works. Including you.

**P.S.** - I'm not even going to ask you to test it. There's nothing to test. The vulnerability was exposure, and now there's no exposure. QED.
