We cannot reproduce vulnerability findings, but our service keeps signing those pesky messages. We believe it is some sort of quantum computer, quantum teleportation, or a lucky guess.

On a side note, I've rehired the whole engineering team. It cost me equity. Lawyers also made me apologize in writing and will be contacting everybody shortly.

PS. Work from home is canceled.

**From: Alice**

Bob, please just fix it. Make the numbers bigger. I read that bigger keys are more secure.

**From: Bob**

That's... partially correct... but... 

**From: Alice**

Great! Do that. Make everything bigger. 

**From: Bob**

But... what about our original solution?

**From: Alice**

Add that one too. Add everything. If this doesn't work, I'm pivoting the company to NFTs.

**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION (Bob):**

Per executive directive, we've increased all cryptographic parameters to maximum practical sizes. This addresses theoretical quantum threats that won't exist for another 20-30 years, while still leaving us vulnerable to... other things.

The system is now cryptographically excessive. Whether this makes it more secure is a philosophical question I'm not paid enough to answer.

**P.S. (Alice)** - If your patch breaks causality, please file it yesterday.
